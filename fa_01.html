        <h4><span>January 27, 2021</span></h4>

        <h1><span>MDEF Reflection</span></h1>
        <p><span>Initial Questions</span></p>
        <p><span>Going beyond the deliverables for this week, one crucial
            question is how to update my personal documentation workflow.
            This is my third formal attempt at Fab Acadcemy, and the final
            project proposal has shifted in it's feasibility. Instead of
            building a full laptop, I can use a Raspberry Pi for the main
            computer unit. Therefore, most of the functionality when
            creating a device that embodies "Indigitization" will be through
            the peripherals needed to capture images and audio. I have also
            thought about extending language documentation through my
            initial 1PP (first person perspective) intervention during Term
            2 of MDEF. Language in Context provides data in the form of
            photos, text, and audio generated through TTS (Text-to-Speech
            sysnthesis) and machine learning. It would be good to see how
            the final project device fiots within the laguage documentation
            and exploration in future interventions.</span></p>
        <p><span>Facts: An objective account of what happened</span></p>
        <p><span>There were very few "content deltas" in regards to this
            week from the previous iterations of Fab Academy in 2015 and
            2018. So, most of the work was done by porting over existing
            work from previous years. That said, the reflections related to
            MDEF help to contextualize previous work within the scope of
            social interventions.</span></p>
        <p><span>Feelings: The emotional reactions to the situation</span></p>
        <p><span>I have often felt frustrated by the learning structure of
          Fab Academy, due to previous attempts being remote. I have
          cultivated a great community of practice over the past seven
          years with the International Fab Lab Network. That said, it is a
          relief to study and follow the program in an environment that is
          supportive. My sense is that I will be able to focus on scaling
          my projects across several platforms and build a local community
          of practice in regards to the social interventions that I
          develop.</span></p>
        <p><span>Findings: The concrete learning that you can take away
          from the situation</span></p>
        <p><span>After doing much of the work over the past six years
          through attempts at Fab Academy and refining my website through
          Term 1 of MDEF, my greatest takeaway is to be confident with the
          tools that I use whether in bits or atoms. I need to spend less
          time fighting with technology and trying alternative solutions
          to ensure that my workflows are repeatable. Furthermore, others
          should be able to learn from my own experiences.</span></p>
        <p><span>Future: Structuring your learning such that you can use it
          in the future</span></p>
        <p><span>I have previously experimented with Fab Foundation's
          SCOPES-df platform to scale out my projects into K-12 lessons.
          In that way, my projects are repeatable and adaptable for
          educational opportunities in public schools in the United
          States. I further embedded Indigenous educational principles
          such as working with traditional knowledge keepers or elders
          that would enforce adoption within Indigenous communities. It is
          important for me that my work reflect a respect for
          community-based educational principles.</span></p>
        <p><span>Final Open Questions</span></p>
        <p><span>As the development of Fab Academy progresses and a
          diversity of perspectives and langauges gradually get introduced
          into the online platform. I am wondering about how that will
          shape the overall international knowledge base. What will it
          mean to share knowledge in an open source framework, when we
          foster opportunities for Indigenous communities? when we are
          response to the needs and concerns of traditional knowledge
          keepers?</span></p>

        <p><span>Joel; the technology is marching at an exponential rate,
          but what about society?</span></p>
        <p><span>Alan; disciplines and ideas for businesses tend to
          overlap.</span></p>
        <p><span>Joel; domain is Social Science. What is the path? Neither
          dystopian nor techno-optimism. Both parents were college
          professors of industrial relations and labor arbitrators. Begins
          with labor management principles but transitions into large
          systems. Installation of fab lab takes about a month.
          Organization of organizations to support a fab lab takes about
          two years.</span></p>
        <p><span>Alan; going from Hollywood to video games. Power of video
          games as a medium was huge. Game for Change, chasing millions of
          dollars without much impact on the other end of development.
          Every project is a multistakeholder project. Cook Inlet Tribal
          Council, how to empower youth and direct their own narrative
          within the media? CITC is largest stakeholder in e-Line Media.
          Development of FAB game triggered the installation of a fab lab.</span></p>
        <p><span>The book starts with a hypothetical time travel episode
          back into 1965. If you are a policy maker or a social scientist,
          what are the questions of inclusion? Social sciences were
          reactive to the science in reality. Today, four billion people
          still have no access to the Internet. A fab lab can not function
          as designed without the access. Most of the planet is
          ill-equipped to reap the benefits of digital fabrication
          technology.</span></p>
        <p><span>&quot;The Internet is not a luxury, it is a
          necessity&quot;, Barack Obama. If we look at the next fifty
          years of FAB, what are the issues of FAB divides and FAB access?
          Access and literacy are a part of FAB inclusion. Computer
          acquisition did not match with literacy promotion. Technology
          sat while literacy attempted to catch up. Fab Labs leverage
          multiple domains, disciplines, skills, and dispositions.</span></p>
        <p><span>The process of making things has enormous benefits. We are
          not however at a point in which we can make what we consume.
          What is usually overlooked are enabling ecosystems. One of the
          most important things in the Fab ecosystem is the mentor. People
          are desperate for mentors. We need a fullbright type of
          scholarship that can enable a Jens-like journey to cultivate
          mentors.</span></p>
        <p><span>Joel; there are about 15 - 20 needed platforms. How to
          cultivate mentors? How to do equipment repair? How to share
          designs? Platforms are currently being cobbled together, not so
          much being implemented on a global scale. How can you anticipate
          change, align stakeholders, cultivate ecosystems so that social
          and technical can co-evolve?</span></p>
        <p><span>
          Alan; how can we error correct the social along with the
          technical? Social error correction is much slower, but could be
          accelerated. How does toxic behavior proliferate? How does
          positive behavior proliferate? Immediate feedback loops with
          buy-in from the community on the methodologies. Brendan Maher, <a class="falinks" href="https://www.nature.com/polopoly_fs/1.19647!/menu/main/topColumns/topLeftColumn/pdf/531568a.pdf" target="_blank">&quot;Good Gaming: Scientists are helping
            to tame toxic behaviour in the world&apos;s most popular online
            game.&quot;</a> Social science error correction married with
          technology.
        </span></p>
        <p><span>Government, Philanthropy, Corporate, Distributed; Fab
          Solutions: inclusion a focus and priority now...</span></p>
        <p><span>How do we reduce friction for people wanting to join the
          network? For any system, risk mitigation is a concern. Fab risks
          include ethics around weapons and biofabrication. If the number
          of fab labs doubles every year and a half, consumables needed to
          faciliate become an ecological risk. Fair treatment, succession
          planning, depend on the existence of a physical work space; what
          happens when the work space is distributed?</span></p>
        <p><span>The Fab Charter is way out of date. There is nothing in
          the charter that governs how big decisions are made.</span></p>
        <div class="body-text-img">
          <img src="assets/images/fab-charter.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p><span>Fab Labs make us rethink the concept of work. There is
          potential for a blended economy (i.e., volunteer hours producing
          work credits). Impact of Moore&apos;s Law at Intel is analogous
          to the boulder scene in raiders of the Lost Ark, work racing
          innovation at an exponential rate.</span></p>
        <p><span>What if we think of organizations in modular terms?</span></p>

        <p><span>Alan; head (logic), heart (human face and emotion), hands
          (experience and feedback leading to a path forward). When you
          get invited into something you care about, you fail most of the
          time but you are getting feedback. The consideration of the
          three concepts is important to promote a movement centered
          around FAB inclusion.</span></p>

          a design idea on paper and in the computer</span></h4>
        <p><span>For a few generations, my family has served as keepers of
          the ways of my tribe. We hold our story and song tradition
          close. Over the past year, I have participated in a couple
          conferences to gain insight on the role of technology in
          language and culture preservation. Background</span></p>
        <p><span>There is a wealth of classic media that exists documenting
          tribal culture, both oral and material. Much of the resources
          require efficient digitization and curation. These resources
          serve to inform language and culture preservation and
          revitalization initiatives.</span></p>
        <p><span>
          Costs of object-centric digitization, analysis and curation can
          be prohibitive. At The University of British Columbia, the <a class="falinks" href="http://www.ikebarberlearningcentre.ubc.ca/programs/indigitization/" target="_blank">Irving K. Barber Learning Centre</a> hosts a
          collaborative project known as &quot;Indigitization.&quot; The
          project seeks to clarify processes and identify issues in the
          conservation and digitization of First Nation community
          information resources.
        </span></p>
        <p><span>
          I learned about <a class="falinks" href="http://www.indigitization.ca/" target="_blank">Indigitization</a> by attending the annual
          meeting of the American Anthropological Association. During that
          meeting, I learned of the Indigitzation Toolkit. Similar to Fab
          Lab technology, the toolkit supports community efforts at
          digitization taking analog communication (language and texts)
          and curating it as bits.
        </span></p>
        <p><span>Access to curated information presents another challenge
          for community preservationists. Instead of a publicly open and
          accessible system, proper consideration must be given with
          respect to community set guidelines. Some information can be
          deemed sensitive based on age, gender, and whether or not the
          person accessing is a community member.</span></p>

        <p><span>
          I chose the form of a brief case in reference to <a class="falinks" href="http://vimeo.com/45911972" target="_blank">Pop Fab</a>,
          designed by Ilan Moyer and Nadya Peek. I want to create a
          portable device for digitization and curation. I chose the name
          Indigi-Case to be descriptive and allude to the fact that I base
          the proposal on the Indigization toolkit.
        </span></p>
        <p><span>The case itself is a cross between a netbook and a
          Nintendo 3DS. It features a cassette deck &#x201C;drive&#x201D;
          for digitzation of classic media. I added two jacks for
          headphones and speakers. Two usb ports for devices. I plan to
          embed a keyboard in one side of the case. Facing opposite, is an
          LCD screen with two internal speakers. Above the screen is an
          internal camera. On the outside of the case, I have a
          stereoscopic camera for 3D pictures and video of material
          culture or subjects/informants.</span></p>

        <p><span>After some thought, I decided to go with a different
          design that was based on pottery that was more culturally
          expressive of my own Tribe. I based my design off the
          Mississippian spider motif which is representative of Choctaw
          stories of how Grandmother Spider brought fire to the people.</span></p>

          <strong>What is Digital Fabrication</strong>
        </span></p>
        <p><span>There are three digital revolutions. Phones used to
          degrade with distance. Now we use the Internet to talk.
          Computers used to degrade with time.</span></p>
        <p><span>
          Moore&apos;s Law, <a class="falinks" href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~fussell/courses/cs352h/papers/moore.pdf" target="_blank">&quot;Cramming more components onto
            integrated circuits&quot;</a>. Concept of doubling scale. From
          components and transistors to &quot;Lass&apos; Law&quot; which
          plots the doubling of fab labs within the International Fab Lab
          Network.
        </span></p>
        <p><span>Connecting computers to machines was invented at MIT in
          1952. The Whirlwind was the first real time computer. Around
          that time, jet aircraft were emerging. The parts were too hard
          to make by hand. The idea was that a real time computer could be
          connected to a machine to &quot;turn the crank&quot;.</span></p>
        <p><span>
          Vannevar Bush, he made the first analog computer at MIT. Claude
          Shannon was frustrated with using a computer that accumulated
          errors over time. <a class="falinks" href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/11173" target="_blank">&quot;A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and
            Switching Circuits&quot;</a> proves that Boolean algebra could be
          used to simplify the arrangement of relays used for
          communication. Shannon&apos;s work was applied by von Neumann to
          computation. Digital is a scaling property. By using a symbol
          representing the linear increase in the use of resources,
          whether in computation or communication; the error rate drops
          exponentially.

        <p><span>Digital fabrication was &quot;invented&quot; four billion
          years ago. Humans are constructed from 20 amino acids which work
          like molecular Lego. Amino acids have properties. Ribosomes are
          assemblers that bolt together amino acids. Human bodies are then
          constructed &quot;digitally&quot;.</span></p>
        <p><span>On the surface level, digital fabrication is using a
          computer and a tool to make something. The deeper meaning is
          creating the code to make the thing.</span></p>
        <p><span>MIT&apos;s Center for Bits and Atoms facilitates a ten
          million dollar &quot;fab lab&quot;, which is a suite of research
          tools. There was a bottle neck on instruction of how to use the
          tools. This lead to the creation of &quot;How to Make (almost)
          Anything&quot;. Projects from this class answered not so much
          &quot;how&quot; but &quot;why&quot; to do digital fabrication.</span></p>
        <p><span>Following the parallel of development of computation, the
          Whirlwind was transistorized into the MIT TX-0 computer. TX-0
          was commercialized into the PDP. The birth of modern computing
          happened at Bell Labs with the PDP, this was reflected in a
          scaling down physically of equipment from a building scale to a
          room. Ken Olsen was skeptical about the personal computer
          stating, &quot;There is no reason for any individual to have a
          computer in his home&quot;. The killer app for computing
          ultimately became personal computing. The parallel discovered in
          the HTMaA class was that digital fabrication could be used to
          make products for a market of one, personal fabrication.</span></p>
        <p><span>Educational outreach from CBA lead to the Fab Lab
          programming. The community-based Fab Lab is analogous to the PDP
          in scale. Filling the room, it is one machine or system for
          digital fabrication. One machine cannot make almost anything.
          The collection of fab lab machine can rather output any such
          projects.</span></p>
        <p><span>Need to follow up: Haakon, nomadic herding and land use
          applications.</span></p>
        <p><span>The International Fab Lab Network is part of the broader
          Maker movement. It is a more curated facet of the movement. No
          one is pushing populations to build fab labs, the labs are
          pulled into remarkable settings around the world.</span></p>
        <p><span>Fab Academy is distributed education, distinct from
          learning at the institution or online instruction. Participating
          Fab Lab nodes are an extension of the campus. A number of the
          class projects become businesses all came out of homework
          assignments in the Fab Academy.</span></p>
        <p><span>How to Grow (alomost) Anything came from a collaboration
          with George Church.</span></p>
        <p><span>Fabricademy is digital fabrication meeting textiles.</span></p>
        <p><span>MIT is a mainframe. Online classes are still centrally
          facilitated from a mainframe. Fab Academy is a distributed
          educational network. It is not so much controlled centrally.</span></p>
        <p><span>Seymour Papert, fab labs lead to the literacy of not just
          how to use technology, but how to also build technology.</span></p>
        <p><span>Fab Labs in Barcelona, fab labs could be used to start a
          business. Fab labs can also be used to make what people consume.
          The connection is open globally for knowledge. The atoms, matter
          stays within Barcelona for production. Fab Cities initiative is
          about local governments pledging to take on self-sufficiency.
          This does not lead to the creation of traditional jobs, but it
          does empower consumers to produce what they consume.</span></p>
        <p><span>Personal manufacturing will ultimately replace traditional
          manufacturing.</span></p>
        <p><span>Global Humanitarian Lab; instead of managing relief by
          physically sending solutions, the global network could send data
          and solutions could be manufactured locally.</span></p>
        <p><span>FABx events; 11 was when the network descended upon MIT.
          FAB12 took the event to Shenzhen, China. Mass manufacturing
          plays a role in producing tools needed to create solutions
          locally.</span></p>
        <p><span>Fab Foundation manages capacity. FabLabs.io is a social
          network for fab labs. If anybody can make anything, anywhere;
          what are the organizations to help manage that ability? Similar
          to ICANN and sister organizations on Internet Architecture
          Board.</span></p>
        <p><span>
          Scale; we are now going from 1,000 to 1,000,000 fab labs. One
          million is the number of towns in the world. To go from one
          point of scale to another, How to Make Something That Makes
          (almost) Anything was developed. Modular software and modular
          hardware helps to rapidly make machines. Nadya Peek, <a class="falinks" href="http://infosyncratic.nl/peek-making-machines.pdf" target="_blank">&quot;Making Machines that Make:
            Object-Oriented Hardware Meets Object-Oriented Software&quot;</a>.
          Jens Dyvik built upon the work of modular machines. The idea is
          to make a machine that would be capable of making its own parts.
          The next step of fab labs is to be able to composed and design
          parts for machines that make.
        </span></p>
        <p><span>From one million to one billion; this is the number of
          people on Earth. The supply chain needs to be deprecated. How
          can materials be digitized?</span></p>
        <p><span>
          From one billion to one trillion, this is the Internet of Things
          but for a manufacturing application. Ribosomes are slow they
          make complex structures at one molecule per second. Ribosomes
          also construct other ribosomes. Hierarchy in biology is parallel
          in engineering. Blending communication and computation for
          fabrication output. John von Neumann, <a class="falinks" href="http://cba.mit.edu/events/03.11.ASE/docs/VonNeumann.pdf" target="_blank">&quot;Theory of Self-Reproducing
            Automata&quot;</a>.
        </span></p>
        <p><span>Manufacturing is going from a mainframe to a minicomputer
          (fab lab) to a personal computer (mtm) to ubiquitous (Star Trek
          Replicator). Research to reach ubiquitous takes fifty years, we
          are currently in the middle of that path, the &quot;mini
          computer&quot; era. The class is teaching digital fabrication,
          but also asks what is: business, education, governance, and how
          does the world change?</span></p>

        <p><span>Notes from our guru, Terence Fagan:</span></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p></span>To use Mercurial is a different story, Neil said there
            was a stiff learning curve and there was anticipated mistakes
            the first week. I wanted to make sure this did not happen,
            neither did Francisco Sanchez Arroyo, our instructor. So, he
            gave us a small tutorial below. It worked without a hitch.</span></p>
          <p><span>Standard Workflow &#x2013; In case no one is
            pushing/pulling at the same time, this will happen:</span></p>
          <p><span>hg pull</span></p>
          <p><span>hg update</span></p>
          <p><span>hg addremove</span></p>
          <p><span>hg commit -m &quot;describe your changes&quot;</span></p>
          <p><span>hg push</span></p>
          <p><span>Merge workflow &#x2013; The following happens when you
            have pulled the archive, but before pushing, someone -Quick
            Billy- pushed his changeset. As time tends to &gt; zero,
            probability of this situation to happen tends to infinite. Do
            not worry. This is how it happens:</span></p>
          <p><span>hg pull</span></p>
          <p><span>hg update</span></p>
          <p><span>hg addremove</span></p>
          <p><span>hg commit -m &quot;your changes&quot;</span></p>
          <p><span>NEVER FORCE PUSH or you will receive the email that you
            do not want to receive from Neil. So do the following:</span></p>
          <p><span>hg merge</span></p>
          <p><span>hg commit -m &quot;merge&quot;</span></p>
          <p><span>hg push</span></p>

        <p><span>It was after the first lecture for this cycle of Fab
          Academy that I worked out a procedure that would allow me to
          work from multiple devices. I cloned the repository to Mama
          Rosie&apos;s desktop. Eclipse is an editor that I was
          comfortable with using from my previous web work. I could work
          on the code locally and push to the server. To solve the need
          for a local copy, I turned on a localhost server on Mama Rosie.
          I then copied my student folder to a subfolder of the local
          WebServer. In order to keep the code up to date, I tried some
          solutions for file synchronization. Unison was one option that
          we covered in the lecture. This solution needed a couple
          dependencies and some edits to config files. After a couple
          attempts, the build still failed on OS X El Capitan. It was then
          that I resolved, when we cover topics we aren&apos;t exactly
          mandated to use the options covered. Unison and rsync are
          recommendations, but I needed a currently supported app that
          would synchronize the contents of two local folders. I found
          Sync Folders on the App Store. This not only works with Mama
          Rosie running El Capitan, but also with my home laptop which
          runs Lion. I can sync folders and push to the repository much
          faster.</span></p>

        <p><span>Overall, I would still compose a website originally in
          CMS, mirror and flatten to HTML. Instead of regular updates,
          it&apos;s better to set a template and then edit the HTML from
          Eclipse. There is some housekeeping to do, but I&apos;m happy
          with the current workflow.</span></p>
        <h4 id="background"><span>Background</span></h4>
        <p><span>In a previous life, I was an Internet Marketing Specialist
          for Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, CT. I helped manage six of their
          company websites using proprietary content managements systems
          and flat HTML. I got comfortable with working first with a local
          copy and pushing content to a server that was scheduled to cache
          every four hours.</span></p>

          I started class work for <a class="falinks" href="http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/na/students/pierite.jean-luc/old-site/index.html" target="_blank">Fab Academy in 2015</a>. Back then, we used
          Mercurial for version control. Repositories were divided by
          region. Continuing my work after FAB12 with Fab Lab Wgtn, I
          started to work in the git repository under a network folder
          with a very binary student ID.

        <p><span>Originally, I built my website with a local copy of
          Wordpress. I triple booted my work computer, &#x201C;Mama
          Rosie&#x201D;, and installed the CMS on an Ubuntu partition. As
          I made updates to my website, I mirrored it with httrack to make
          flat HTML files. This was a workflow that I used through Fab
          Academy 2015 and 2016.</span></p>
        <p><span>As part of my job deploying fab lab inventory to new fab
          lab installations, I work out standard procedures for dual or
          triple booting computers and installing all the necessary
          freeware. Recently, we started to get requests for computers
          with Windows 10. Dual booting these machines wasn&apos;t working
          out too well. There was an issue with Ubuntu corrupting wireless
          networking drivers on the Windows side. We resolved with those
          fab labs like Fab Lab NOLA to run Ubuntu in VirtualBox.</span></p>
        <div class="body-text-img">
          <img src="assets/images/mama-rosie.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p><span>I decided to try the same setup with Mama Rosie. I had to
          migrate the local Wordpress installation from the Ubuntu
          partition to the Vbox installation. I then mirrored and
          flattened the site. Even under VirtualBox, the workflow was
          pretty slow. To scan and flatten the site took up to 30 minutes,
          each time. I also had to go to The Fab Foundation office to work
          on my documentation.</span></p>
        <h4 id="2018-class-notes"><span>2018 Class Notes</span></h4>
        <p><span>At the lowest level, the work for this assignment is
          synchronization. rsync is a tool that enables peer-to-peer
          synchronization. This reconciles what changes were made and what
          needs to be copied. This will only copy changes and can be used
          to synchronize TB of data.</span></p>
        <p><span>Version control does multiple things: synchronize work
          between computers, manage the history of the work, collaborate
          with other people on projects, remotely manage content on a
          server. The most popular tool for version control is called,
          git. Github is a web platform that uses git, but has interface
          tools for collaboration. The Fab Cloud is a gitlab installation
          for the fab lab network. We will use git to compose the website,
          but publish through Fab Cloud.</span></p>
        <p><span>Dropbox is a cloud version of content management. Under
          the hood, DropBox runs version control. ownCloud is a similar
          tool to DropBox.</span></p>
        <p><span>Once git is learned, we will be able to share work with
          the class through the server.</span></p>
        <p><span>
          W3C is a program run out of MIT that standardizes the web. HTML5
          is the current web standard. HTML is how we write a webpage. On
          the lowest level, we can write the actual code. A simple editor
          such as vi could be used to compose these pages. A cheat sheet
          of commands can be found, <a class="falinks" href="http://www.atmos.albany.edu/daes/atmclasses/atm350/vi_cheat_sheet.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Neil tends to work at a lower level
          than other people, because he likes control. :)
        </span></p>
        <p><span>Atom, Sublime, Geany are open editors. WYSIWYG (what you
          see is what you get) editing can be done from a higher level
          editor such as LibreOffice. It is more complex, because the
          editor will add code automatically that will make the code more
          compliant to web standards. Other, more graphical editors, such
          as DreamWeaver can also be used. Javascript can be used to add
          programs and interactivity to web pages. During the Interface
          programming week, we will revisit Javascript to build
          applications.</span></p>
        <p><span>CGI, PHP is used to run code on servers. These are a
          security risk. For modern web programming and the scope of the
          class, these are not needed.</span></p>
        <p><span>Low level text editors are ancient, but good for control.
          Experiment with a WYSIWYG editor. Document the range of
          experience with these tools.</span></p>
        <p><span>Above flat HTML are content management systems, these are
          frameworks for managing group sets of pages. CMS have code
          running on the server. Each one has assumptions of how the
          individuals work. They are popular and used commercially. For
          the Fab Academy repo, using flat HTML outside of CMS makes the
          results more personal and expressive.</span></p>
        <p><span>For videoconferences, historically the class was run
          through an MCU which is expensive around $500k centrally. The
          class is now run through BlueJeans via &quot;the cloud&quot; and
          WebRTC. OBS is an open source video broadcasting studio with
          tools for editing.</span></p>
        <p><span>For remote screen sharing, VNC is a standard for screen
          sharing. Neil is running a virtual machine on the cloud that
          runs VNC for screen sharing. noVNC is a viewer that can be run
          from a web browser.</span></p>
        <p><span>Cloud computing, Amazon EC2 (elastic cloud computing) is a
          popular platform. These are useful when you need more computing
          capacity. Heroku is also cloud computing, but more specifically
          for app development.</span></p>
        <p><span>Project Management Systems, these are more intended for
          managing more than one person completing more than one task.
          Example programs are useful such as, TaskJuggler, OpenProj,
          GanttProject, Trello, and Taiga. For the class, project
          management will be centered around GitLab.</span></p>
        <p><span>GitLab is many different things. It manages repositories.
          A repository is a set of files, is the history of the files, and
          can have branches for multiple versions. A second thing that
          GitLab does is issue tracking. Each project has its own issue
          tracker. In GitLab you can manage notifications. If you set a
          certain project to &quot;watch&quot;, you will receive email
          notifications of issues as they arise. The communication is
          threaded. These issues trackers can cut down on email spam.
          Workflows, GitLab runs workflows to publish student content to
          the web. GitLab also has kanban boards that can help manage
          projects. GitLab has an in-browser editor to do editing on the
          server. The editor is not optimal for composition. Rather, you
          can do quick edits.</span></p>
        <p><span>Standard mistakes, students will produce MB of data per
          week; labs will produce GB per cycle. Filesize is important to
          check, du is a good tool for filesize checking. Do not put
          uncompressed images into the repo. If more than one person is
          working on a repo, merge first and then push to the server.</span></p>

          <strong>Project Management Principles</strong>
        </span></p>
        <p><span>There is an important distinction between demand and
          supply-side time management. Supply-side time management is
          working back from the available time. Budget in advance the time
          needed for specific tasks. You can learn to work to a schedule.
          Do not work until you can succeed in each task. instead, work
          with the time that you have available.</span></p>
        <p><span>Serial vs. parallel development; rather than work through
          tasks serially, look for ways to manage multiple tasks in
          parallel. Work out the dependencies for tasks.</span></p>
        <p><span>Spiral development; rather than working on the complete
          system in a series of tasks, look for ways to prototype projects
          iteratively. This will result in a nested series of projects
          that add more upon iteration.</span></p>
        <p><span>Bottom-up vs top-down debugging; rather than taking a big
          thing that doesn&apos;t work, think of projects through
          hierarchy and modularity. If you break your system into modules,
          you can debug the modules in isolation and then plug them back
          together.</span></p>
        <p><span>Document as you work; if you work and then document, you
          will fail. Ara Knaian, the product of engineering if the
          documentation. Record, keep a running log of work, upon the
          completion of the project you will only need to add the final
          documentation.</span></p>
        <p><span>Insights from Mythical Man-Month; a pregnancy is an
          example of a task that does not scale by adding labor but has
          fundamental limitations on the rate that progress can happen.</span></p>
        <p><span>Project Management is not implicit; rather it is a set of
          skills that will develop over the course of the cycle.</span></p>
        <h4 id="jan-22-recitation-version-control-fiore-basile"><span>Jan
          22 recitation: version control (Fiore Basile)</span></h4>
        <p><span>What is version control? This is a way to keep track of
          the work that you do on a project, especially when working with
          a group. Collaboration; while working on a document,
          historically you would work a file at a time. For complex
          documents, there could be many changes resulting in many
          different version of a document taking up hard drive space.
          Change can be restored in a single repository through version
          control. Different changes can be tracked, as well.</span></p>
        <p><span>Making copies of files; normally you would use a function
          like &quot;Save as...&quot; that would create different versions
          of the same project. Instead of making multiple files, we can
          think of development as engaging a database. For cloud
          applications, the act of saving can instantiate separate
          versions in whcih changes are tracked and can be restored. For
          version control, we don&apos;t just use a single, central
          database. This can be done in a distributed way.</span></p>
        <p><span>History and tools; SCCS was a way to manage version
          control in the 1970&apos;s. This solution was local due to the
          lack of robust networking solutions. CVS and Subversion came
          into use in the late 1980s and 90s which introduced client
          server communication. Mercurial was a solution used in previous
          cycles of Fab Academy, but had issues with merging files. Git is
          now an industry standard and a good skill to learn.</span></p>
        <p><span>Git was born out of necessity. Bitkeeper was used for
          tracking the Linux Kernel. The company retired their free
          version. Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux, coded Git based on
          concepts borrowed from Bitkeeper.</span></p>
        <p><span>How Git works. Snapshot vs Deltas; old version control
          solutions compare the difference between files. Snapshots are
          made for every file that are entered into a repository. Git
          enables local operation meaning that you do not have to connect
          to the network; you can instead work with all the files locally.
          In order to do this, you check out the project to your working
          directory. You can then make changes and commit the changes to
          then push to the repository. Entering the files into the repo
          essentially creates two separate versions.</span></p>
        <p><span>
          After installation, you can set a local identity from
          <code>git config</code>
          .
          <code>git init</code>
          will create your repository. This will create an empty folder
          with a hidden folder called &quot;.git&quot;. It is important to
          not delete the &quot;.git&quot; folder. In the initialized
          repository, you can create files and add with
          <code>git add</code>
          .
          <code>git status</code>
          will give you the current status of the repository; this can
          include tracked and untracked files. Untracked files can be
          added or ignored prior to
          <code>git commit</code>
          . Committing files with
          <code>git commit -m &quot;somestatus&quot;</code>
          , will allow you to identify changes as you add to your
          repository. Ignoring files is done through
          <code>.gitignore</code>
          . Ignoring helps to keep repository clean. You can also have
          files locally that you do not want to expose globally.
          <code>git diff &quot;filename&quot;</code>
          is used to output the difference between the a file and
          it&apos;s previously committed version.
          <code>git rm</code>
          is the proper way to remove committed files.
          <code>git mv</code>
          is used for moving and renaming files.
          <code>git log</code>
          will give a history of who did what in a certain repository or
          project.
        </span></p>
        <p><span>Working with remote repositories; the most common way of
          working with your repositories is SSH. Via SSH you can transmit
          via any protocol, including git.</span></p>
