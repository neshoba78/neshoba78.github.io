								<h1><span>Communicating Emergent Futures - Three
									Learning Objectives</span></h1>

										<h4><span>February 5, 2021</span></h4>

											<p><span>At the end of this class the student will be able to:</span></p>
											<p><span>-use existing platforms to make and communicate "meaning"</span></p>
											<p><span>-focus on multi-scalar relationships--beyond MDEF--within
												their mapped ecosystem: local community, broader community of
												practice, and the world</span></p>
											<p><span>-understand how interventions embed ideas, opinions, and
												attitudes through storytelling to shape emergent futures</span></p>

											<div class="body-text-img">

											</div>

											<h4><span>Initial Questions</span></h4>

											<p><span>What is the definition of "meaning" in this course?</span></p>
											<p><span>How do interventions embody ideas, opinions and attitudes?</span></p>

											<h4><span>Facts: An objective account of what happened</span></h4>

											<p><span>We were asked to identify three learning objectives. I
												decided to reword the course description into a bulleted list.
												There were some basic threads that we explored earlier in the
												program such as the idea of a multi scalar ecosystem which
												designers must map and navigate. I further decided to use the
												structure from Santi to reflect more deeply.</span></p>

											<h4><span>Feelings: The emotional reactions to the situation</span></h4>

											<p><span>With my background as a singer and legend keeper for my
												Tribe, I have a sense of how stories work in our own context.
												Stories can be one sentence or one paragraph. What happens is
												that as the storyteller recounts the piece, new meanings emerge.
												Stories are a journey in this way. There's deeper levels of
												knowledge, but it takes time to access them.</span></p>

											<h4><span>Findings: The concrete learning that you can take away
												from the situation</span></h4>

											<p><span>By setting my own learning objectives, I approach the
												class in a way of learning by teaching. Furthermore, the
												learning objectives are an intervention in themselves as it is a
												collaborative design through feedback on a short description of
												a course. I don't know much about the structure or the content,
												but I can set goals based on bits of information.</span></p>

											<h4><span>Future: Structuring your learning such that you can use it
												in the future</span></h4>

											<p><span>What will be interesting to see is whether the learning
												objectives will be allowed to be adjusted based upon the content
												as the course progresses.</span></p>

											<h4><span>Final Open Questions</span></h4>

											<p><span>Will the objectives be adjusted?</span></p>
											<p><span>What meaning will the objectives take on as the course
												progresses?</span></p>
											<p><span>How will I self-assess my work in this course?</span></p>
