        <p><span>Oh. My God. It&apos;s like I&apos;ve always thought. <a class="falinks" href="http://splitsider.com/2017/03/building-on-sacred-ground-with-the-new-cast-of-mst3k/" target="_blank">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a> is a parody of my
            work at The Fab
            Foundation!</span></p>
        <p><span>For the uninitiated, MST3K is about a random guy working at a scientific institute. He could be a janitor, temp, or glorified truck driver. In any case, a boss character who generally specializes in the &quot;Mad&quot; field of
            science
            subjects the host to torture in the form of &quot;cheesy movies.&quot; Given my experience with customs documentations, I&apos;d rather be watching Gamera movies.</span></p>
        <p><span>Despite the torture, the host maintains sanity with the help of robots made from parts that were meant to control the movies. Not sure how a gumball machine, bowling pins, or flash light hot glued to an unimaginable amount of hose
            would
            control a movie. I couldn&apos;t even tell you the amount of programming of AI that would be required to get robots to do comedy riffs.</span></p>
        <p><span>When I was growing up though, Thanksgiving was &quot;Turkey Day&quot;; a marathon day for MST3K. A sci-fi puppet show really helps as a coping mechanism for colonial legacy.</span></p>
        <p><span>What was the connection? Oh yeah, Jonah just happened to say, &quot;CNC in my Fab Lab.&quot;</span></p>
        <h4 id="visiting-mits-center-for-bits-and-atoms"><span>Visiting MIT&apos;s Center for Bits and Atoms</span></h4>
        <p><span>There&apos;s a tutorial for this assignment on The Center for Bits and Atoms site, <a class="falinks" href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/tools/shopbot/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I didn&apos;t know that in 2015. So, what
            ended up happening is
            that I went to the CBA shop and bothered the &quot;Spiciest Meme Lord&quot; Tom Lutz.</span></p>
        <div class="body-text-img"><img src="assets/images/IMG_3858.JPG" alt=""></div>
        <p><span><em>They&apos;re not playing around in the CBA Shop. Oh yeah, cause you can lose limbs or die...</em></span></p>
        <p><span>He walked me through the process of using Partworks, setting up the ShopBot, and not losing eyes or fingers in the process. With those surviving eyes and fingers, I took copious notes.</span></p>
        <p><span><img src="assets/images/SHOPBOT NOTES FROM CBA.jpg" alt=""></span></p>
        <p><span><em>#Copious</em></span></p>
        <p><span>With Tom&apos;s assistance, I was able to design and cut out a monogram plaque which I keep by my work desk to this day.</span></p>

        <p><span><em>Baby&apos;s first machining project</em></span></p>
        <h4 id="trouble-at-the-southend-technology-center"><span>Trouble at The Southend Technology Center</span></h4>
        <p><span>After taking that nice lesson, I returned to the South End Technology Center to wrestle with the first ShopBot ever purchased for a Fab Lab. What a bear that thing was. First off, the control box looked like a hollowed out desktop
            tower
            with an emergency stop.</span></p>
        <div class="body-text-img"><img src="assets/images/IMG_3908.JPG" alt=""></div>
        <p><span><em>What the Hell is this??</em></span></p>
        <p><span>It took a visit from Bill Young and an email to Ed Baafi to figure out what the mystery of the setup was. According to Ed, the big e-stop on the PC case is a hardware e-stop which cuts power. The big e-stop on the spindle controller
            is a
            software e-stop that stops a running program.</span></p>
        <p><span>Bill Young&apos;s visit gave us a little history on the &quot;first ShopBot ever purchased for a Fab Lab&quot;:</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><span>We did not know when was the last time the pinion gears were changed, if ever</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span>Dianne Reynolds from ShopBot found the specs on the tool. It&apos;s a PRSstandard96-48-6 4/2007 with a 4hp 1 phase spindle (This is actually important to remember when loading the settings file in the ShopBot software)</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span>We also needed a surfacing bit for leveling the sacrificial board and stock.</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span>The spindle control that had the software e-stop is a V7-4X VFD. We wanted to replace that, but another visit from Ryan Patterson resolved any bugs by updating the firmware</span></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>Next time, I&apos;ll do this assignment on <em>#HardMode</em> by flying to Milan, send my files with LinuxCNC, and machining out my parts with a MECAMATIC MF 150. Right, Fiore?</span></p>
        <h4 id="steps-for-machining"><span>Steps for Machining</span></h4>
        <p><span>Ale Diaz de Leon has a nice summary of work flow on her page that I will adapt and integrate with the tutorials and CBA lesson:</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><span>Prepare the file on the ShopBot software. The result is three layers:</span></p>
            <ul>

              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span><em>#RobertosTip</em> Roberto Gallo, experiment with the design by fabricating scale models to find design errors. Repeat for at least four iterations to get the best results.</span></p>

                software and test that the spindle moves the correct distance of millimeters or inches.</span></p>

          <li>
            <p><span><em>#KonstantinsTip</em> Konstantin Leonenko, don&apos;t forget to air cut. When ready, take time to manually load panel-per-panel and hole-per-hole until confident enough to load simultaneous sides. Use a buddy system for
                fixturing.
                Careful positioning of screws will save stock and stay out of the way for the machine.</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span><em>#ScottsTip</em> Scott Zitek, screws are preferable to clamps which stick up and can easily be hit by a moving spindle. When creating holes for screws on stock, only barely mark the surface.</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span>Drill the screws on the stock to fixture. That way, the stock will not move during the machining</span></p>

          <li>
            <p><span><em>#EmmasTips</em>, if during the milling job the machine stops (it can happen for several reason like electric drop or comunication problems with the computer) it&apos;s important to take note of the line where the job ended.
                Then you
                can start the same job with the option: &quot;start from the line&quot; from the File menu. I suggest to move the bit close to the working area and start the job from two lines before the one you wrote down. For istance if the line
                stopped at line 200, I would start the new job from line 198.</span></p>

          <li>
            <p><span><em>#GonzalosTip</em> Gonzalo Siu, finishing is harder than expected. Even though design can be adjusted parametrically, be prepared for a lot of sanding to chamfer males and widen female slots to perfect joints.</span></p>

        <h4 id="tooling"><span>Tooling</span></h4>
        <p><span>The week of DigiFabCon 2017, I met Ted Hall at Center for Bits and Atoms. His first words to me were, &quot;Oh, so you&apos;re Jean-Luc. I heard everything about you.&quot; Bill Young chuckled, &quot;Well, that&apos;s one way to
            start a
            conversation.&quot; Sallye Coyle of ShopBot (and FAB CNC Guru) was on several adventures with me during the course of my work at The Fab Foundation. We&apos;ve so far been on two lab installs and two FABx meetings.</span></p>
        <p><span>Before I met Sallye, I would create Fab Lab pro forma based solely on the Fab Lab Inventory curated by MIT. The what&apos;s and why&apos;s were normally answered by, &quot;this is what MIT recommends&quot; or &quot;this is what is
            needed
            to take Fab Academy.&quot; That said, I don&apos;t think we ever got around to explaining 5 gallons of machine oil or the $130 USD 1/2&quot; two flute upcut ballnose end mill. I received a spreadsheet on tooling from Sallye that was very
            helpful in explaining what was the right tool for wood-specific applications in a Fab Lab: <a class="falinks" href="assets/uploads/bit-inventory.csv">Right Click + Save</a></span></p>
        <p><span>According to Fiore and Ted Hung, they both used a 10mm flat end mill. It appears the closest in the ShopBot &quot;Router Bit Starter Kit&quot; is the <a class="falinks"

        <p><span>Aside from tooling information, Sallye also composed a very helpful PowerPoint on Fab Lab tools and software: <a class="falinks" href="assets/uploads/fablab-summary-tools-software.zip">Right Click + Save</a></span></p>

        <h4 id="materials"><span>Materials</span></h4>
        <p><span>I used an Oriented Strand Board. It&apos;s fairly inexpensive, but required a hefty delivery charge from Home Depot. Some other things to keep in mind (taking a cue from Isaac Robles), plywood tends to bend while MDF does not. Make
            sure
            all the parts of the machining bed are leveled. This is usually accomplished with a very long level, and measuring on the diagonals.</span></p>

        <p><span>I used Fusion 360 to design the CAD files for Machining. This is a very useful program as it also does CAM.</span></p>
