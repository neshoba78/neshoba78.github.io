											<b>Reflection:</b>
										</span></p>
										<p><span>In September 2020, I was invited to host a panel on
											Indigenous innovation for Global Community Bio Summit 4.0. After
											discussions with prospective panelists, there was a concern
											about the nature of innovation and relationships fostered with
											Indigenous communities. Main issues with innovation centered
											around extraction and appropriation of traditional ecological
											knowledge.</span></p>

										<p><span>Taking a note from my Indigenous futurism reading series
											at North American Indian Center of Boston, I proposed a revised
											framing around Indigenous survivance. “Indigenous survivance” in
											the community based bio research context describes how
											communities and nations are looking inward to imagine
											sustainable futures through community science practices through
											deepening traditional ecological knowledge and affirming
											self-determination.</span></p>

										<p><span>The panel was described as below:</span></p>
										<p><span>
											<b>Event Description / Abstract:</b><br /> <b>One sentence
												description:</b> Indigenous Survivance describes how communities
											and nations are looking inward to imagine sustainable futures
											through community science practices through deepening
											traditional ecological knowledge and affirming
											self-determination.</span>
										</p>

										<p><span>
											<b>Paragraph abstract:</b> Indigenous Survivance describes how
											communities and nations are looking inward to imagine
											sustainable futures through community science practices through
											deepening traditional ecological knowledge and affirming
											self-determination. In comparison to concepts of innovation and
											interdisciplinary collaboration, Indigenous survivance does not
											respond to extractive methodologies to create value. While
											recognizing local communities as distinct, the diversity of the
											panel's perspectives will form a common thread that will elevate
											the consciousness and intentionality of community biolabs.
											Through sharing lived experiences, our panelists will share
											their knowledge, cautionary tales, and their hopes for the
											future through their research and programming.
										</span></p>


										<p><span>Panelists centered their presentations around these
											questions and their own scientific process in community-based
											research:</span></p>

										<p><span>
											Beno Juarez, Fab Lab Lima (Peru)<br /> How can a paradigm shift
											from an extractive economy to a green economy foster equity to
											close disparities which create paradoxes in the Amazon?
										</span></p>

										<p><span>
											Margarita Mora, Nia Tero<br /> How can traditional Indigenous
											governance structures be supported and elevated to steward
											collective territories which provide for the welfare of all
											resident beings?
										</span></p>

										<p><span>
											John Leong, Kupu (Hawaii)<br /> How do we build a pipeline of
											learning through working for young people to take the lead on
											conservation, sustainability, and cultural projects which
											address disproportionate regional rates of endangered species?
										</span></p>

										<p><span>Most related to the content of Biology Zero was the
											methodology used at Fab Lab Lima called Simbiocreacion. The
											methodology is adapted from research by Lynn Margulis. It
											fosters opportunities for participants "to integrate ideas and
											capabilities in a collaborative way, to develop innovative
											products with high global impact through the use of advanced
											technological tools, such as Digital Manufacturing, Robotics,
											Artificial Intelligence, BlockChain, Bio Technology, etc."</span></p>

										<p><span>Ultimately, I'm interested in how we can apply Biology
											Zero through designing systems for collaboration and generation
											of value on local levels. As Margarita points out in the panel,
											communities should be able to prioritize their own indicators
											for development and be supported by systems that protect sacred
											proprietary knowledge. John shares a story in which a youth
											worker finds confidence in the affirmation of ancestral
											knowledge while taro farming. These are the outcomes that I hope
											to achieve through my own interventions.</span></p>

										<p><span>
											<b>Experiment Design</b>
										<span></p>
										<p><span>Following the Material Crafitivism experimentations
											explained below, I decided to detail my questions and process
											through a <a class="mdeflinks" href="https://www.scopesdf.org/scopesdf_lesson/diy-biomaterials-with-acorn-flour/" target="_blank">SCOPES-df</a> lesson plan for others to follow and answer
											the broader questions.</span></p>

										<p><span>The purpose of this exercise is to respond to the
											perception of scarcity of my local lab space and to explore the
											potential of Indigenous traditional ecological knowledge. To
											that effect, I chose to explore my local ecosystem, to catalogue
											the various species and traditional uses, and to process
											materials towards the production of DIY bioplastics.</span></p>

										<p><span>As a designer, my background is in language and culture
											revitalization for my Tribe, the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of
											Louisiana. From time to time, I contribute to tribal programming
											which is done in collaboration with Tulane University in New
											Orleans. I also have over six years of experience with the
											International Fab Lab Network including contributing to works on
											handicrafts and digital design. Locally in Boston,
											Massachusetts; I serve as president of the board of directors
											for the North American Indian Center of Boston which is the
											oldest urban Indian center in the state. We provide cultural and
											social services for the New England Native American community.</span></p>

										<p><span>My exploration of the Atlas of Weak Signals and social
											interventions through the Master in Design for Emergent Futures
											(MDEF) centers Indigenous futurism themes as curated in walking
											the clouds which is edited by Grace Dillon.</span></p>
										<div class="body-text-img">
											<img src="assets/images/materials/IMG_1603.jpg" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p><span>Building on the mapping that was done earlier in Term 1 of
											MDEF, I referred back to my catalogue of local plants available
											at Jamaica Pond which is a public park close to my home. I chose
											this park as it was a place of daily reflection for me while
											quarantining during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
										<div class="body-text-img">
											<img src="assets/images/materials/IMG_1604.jpg" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p><span>After I took a decent sample of local plants, I researched
											possible uses for DIY bioplastics. I also included references
											for regular sources of food waste such as bananas, coffee,
											avocados, and onion peels. After a demonstration by Anastasia
											during a Fabricademy lecture, I referred to the publication,
											“The secrets of bioplastic.” This provided a basis for equipment
											needs and a basic recipe to augment with a variety of materials.
											I further received ingredients from MDEF to use including:
											glycerine, gelatine, agar agar, cork, and avocado pits.</span></p>
										<div class="body-text-img">
											<img src="assets/images/materials/IMG_1607.jpg" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p><span>I did a quick audit of the kitchen set up. At first, I
											noticed that most of what I needed was readily available except
											for a kitchen scale. Instead of immediately buying a scale from
											my local pharmacy, I wanted to know my own options for
											alternatives. I found articles and web apps that act as digital
											scales by using 3D Touch capabilities included in older models
											of iPhones. My personal phone uses haptic touch which excluded
											that route. Ultimately, I am fortunate enough to room with a
											local chef and I was able to use her personal digital scale
											which I found after digging for alternatives.</span></p>
										<div class="body-text-img">
											<img src="assets/images/materials/IMG_1609.jpg" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p><span>Once I resolved the equipment situation, I needed to
											decide at least one plant to work with towards making DIY
											bioplastics. After finding an online tutorial on how to make red
											oak acorn flour, I decided to center my experimentations on the
											processing of acorns towards production.</span></p>
										<div class="body-text-img">
											<img src="assets/images/materials/IMG_1652.jpg" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p><span>I harvested several pounds of of red oak acorns. There
											were plenty on the ground at Jamaica Pond. Still, I wanted to be
											conscious of the food needs of the animals. So, I chose to take
											only a few pounds.</span></p>
										<div class="body-text-img">
											<img src="assets/images/materials/IMG_1657.jpg" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p><span>After harvesting the acorns, I took them home and cracked
											open the shells. At first, I did not have a nutcracker
											available. I did have a tool for breaking open lobster claws.
											This worked well. Most of the online tutorial suggested slower
											processes such as drying the shelled pieces in the Sun and cold
											leaching. This would take weeks in addition to the time needed
											for DIY bioplastic samples to dry. Instead, I used the oven at
											under 200 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours to dry the
											pieces. The result were dried acorn meat pieces with skins
											partially separated. I was able to full separate the meat pieces
											from the skins by rubbing several in my hands. After I separated
											almost all of the skins from the meat pieces, I rinsed the
											pieces in a collander to prepare them for hot-leaching.</span></p>
										<div class="body-text-img">
											<img src="assets/images/materials/IMG_1658.jpg" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p><span>Cold-leaching is a process of allowing the acorn meat
											pieces to soak in a five gallon bucket of water while wrapped in
											cheese cloth. The purpose of this process is to extract tannins
											from the acorn meat. Tannins make the acorns inedible. There is
											however a balance of extracting tannins to produce edible acorn
											flour as opposed to the use of tannins as resins toward the
											production of DIY bioplastics. I found more information in the
											article, “Tannins: An Environmentally-Friendly Ingredient for
											the Plastics Industry” by Christine Kelly in Advanced Science
											News from May 28, 2018. As I chose hot-leaching of the acorn
											meat to extract tannins, I found an extremely sticky resin at
											the bottom of the pot on my first go. As the purpose of my
											experimentation was to first make as edible of an acorn flour as
											possible, I decided to discard the resin. I also did not know
											how best to reserve the resin. Upon reflection, it would be good
											to repeat the process to understand the preservation and use of
											tannin resin.</span></p>
										<div class="body-text-img">
											<img src="assets/images/materials/IMG_1684.jpg" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p><span>The hot-leaching process took almost as much time as
											estimated for the cold-leaching process. While less water was
											used for the hot-leaching process, more gas was used to boil the
											water. So, there is a trade off in resources when making
											decisions to process acorn flour in terms of: time, water, and
											gas or electricity (depending on the stove top and oven).
											Hot-leaching involves bringing the pot of water to a boil and
											then soaking the acorn meat pieces for at least 30 minutes and
											then draining the water. This cycle is repeated until the
											drained water runs clear as opposed to a dark chocolate color.</span></p>
										<div class="body-text-img">
											<img src="assets/images/materials/IMG_1685.jpg" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p><span>Once the acorn meat pieces were sufficiently hot-leached,
											I smashed the pieces into a granular paste using a potato
											masher. It's important to mash the pieces as fine as possible as
											the next step is drying the paste. I dried the pieces in the
											oven again under 200 degrees Fahrenheit for at least six hours.
											During this time, I decided to experiment on mashing and sifting
											flour from nuts using some dried pecans that were in my pantry.
											Once the paste was sufficiently dried, I tried sifting the
											flour. As I did not sufficiently mash the paste, there were
											still large pieces. I used a blender to grind the pieces and
											sifted until I had a sufficient amount of flour to use for
											bioplastics production.</span></p>
										<div class="body-text-img">
											<img src="assets/images/materials/IMG_1686.jpg" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p><span>Using the main recipe from “The secrets of bioplastic”, I
											experimented within the 48 grams of gelatine powder using
											different ratios of ingredients. This included blends of acorn
											flour, gelatine, agar agar, cork, and avocado pits. Each mixture
											was combined with 240ml of water. Once a paste formed, each was
											placed over medium-low flame to which was added the 12 grams of
											glycerine. I used the top lids of plastic take out containers as
											molds. I placed each of the molds on top of a book shelf and
											left them to dry. The apartment was heated during colder
											temperatures. So, I suspected a high place would be good for
											drying. Originally, I covered the blends with plastic wrap. As
											condensation formed on the wrap, I decided to uncover each mold
											and leave them for at least a week.</span></p>
										<div class="body-text-img">
											<img src="assets/images/materials/IMG_1687.jpg" alt="" />
										</div>

										<p><span>In order to do this experiment, I took several shortcuts
											which were intensive on water and gas to conserve time.
											Ultimately, this process could take at least a month to produce
											the flour and sufficiently dry the DIY bioplastic samples.
											Further, more experiments are needed to test tannin resin use
											within the bioplastic samples. This question would be whether
											less leaching is better to retain the tannins within the meat OR
											whether resin can be conserved to be added back in to DIY
											bioplastics. Further, if the resin can be added back in; would
											this impact the ratio of glycerine in the mixture? The most
											successful samples from these experiments were combinations of
											gelatine and avocado pits or acorn flour. The blend of agar agar
											and acorn flour proved somewhat successful as the material
											shrank and curled in the mold. Other blends cracked as they
											dried. In any case, I learned much more about my local
											surroundings and established an ability to harvest plants
											towards DIY bioplastic production.</span></p>
