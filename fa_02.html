        <p><span>
            My final project,<a class="falinks" href="assets/tamahka.zip"> last year</a>,
            went through several evolutions. It started out as a language
            lab in a box. I set out to do for linguistics what Nadya Peek
            and others did for digital fabrication. I roughed out a sketch
            and used GIMP to compile a concept of a brief case/laptop. It
            was a cool thought, but a laptop in a brief case is a bit more
            of Bunnie Huang&#x2019;s speed and not my own.
          </span></p>
        <p><span>The second iteration of my final project concept was a
            ceramic pot with a stylized spider. I used Inkscape to do this
            rendering. I used shape tools and gradients to give the design a
            bit more of a 3D look. The spider was traced from a Bitmap in
            Inkscape. I like working with vectors graphics that you can
            scale to use on small projects like thermography on business
            cards or cut vinyl for signs.</span></p>

          <img src="assets/images/IMG_3590.JPG" alt="">
        </div>
        <p><span>
            My third iteration of my final project concept was a<a class="falinks" href="https://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/na/students/pierite.jean-luc/old-site/index33293329.html?page_id=31">
              stylized alligator toy</a>. I wasn&#x2019;t too sure what the
            project would do, or how a person would interact with the toy. I
            started thinking of ways to incorporate skills, but in a way
            that didn&#x2019;t mean much. I pictured 3D printed cheeks that
            would accent holes for speakers. I hand drew the basic geometry
            and scanned in the art. I then imported the picture into
            Inkscape to trace out an SVG. I imported the SVG into blender
            and got lost in a world of keyboard shortcuts.

            3D model rendered in blender. Steps to convert from 2D to 3D<a class="falinks" href="https://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/na/students/pierite.jean-luc/old-site/index33293329.html?page_id=31"> here</a>.
          </span></p>
        <p><span>As a tool for 3D modeling, I like blender because
            it&#x2019;s free. That said, my original 3D models were either
            Doom levels that I made as a kid, or characters that I modeled
            in OpenGL or 3D Studio Max while I studied Video Game Design at
            Full Sail. I liked those processes because I was able to code my
            designs as opposed to modeling by hand in a GUI.</span></p>
