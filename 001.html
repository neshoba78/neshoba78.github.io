        							<p><span>Defining my new me and my new work space was
        								contextualized in response to a supposed scarcity mindset due to
        								the reality of the pandemic. Previously, I presented on American
        								Indian agricultural use of a nearby creek in relation to
        								opposition to a proposed substation for an energy company. By
        								historical accounts of use of the land, the fish from the creek
        								provide food and spoiled fish provide nitrogen for earth mound
        								gardens which can be formed along the bank of the creek. Seeds
        								of corn, beans, and squash are planted together to form a system
        								of support and collaboration. The corn forms a stalk which the
        								vine of the beans ascend during growth. The beans place nitrogen
        								back into the soil, and squash provides ground cover for each
        								mound. Thinking on this concept, I wanted to approach the issue
        								of scarcity as a matter of perspective.</span></p>

        							<p><span>As opposed to being sad about my grandparents and
        								ancestors no longer being alive, I am grateful for their
        								knowledge and their work which brought our family to this point
        								in our reality. In addition to published works, I wanted to find
        								a way to integrate the knowledge of my ancestors into my design
        								work. I further looked to the nature that I had access to, but
        								up until this point had not critically analyzed the plant life.
        								Using my smartphone, I downloaded an app to start scanning the
        								interesting herbs that I found in my local surroundings. I had
        								to scan plants a few times after first starting to be sure that
        								the AI was picking up the species correctly. While not a perfect
        								source of information, I trusted in the community process that
        								was cultivated before I adopted the application. I looked back
        								at the apps that I already installed. How many times and on how
        								many scales was I already mapping out my own personal universe?</span></p>

        							<p><span>Thinking about the methodologies and tools that I adopted
        								since the beginning of the quarantine, I recognized how going
        								inward built a foundation to look at the world through a lens of
        								abundance. I also used a lens of possibilities by thinking about
        								how to map out my universe by creating a deck of cards. These
        								cards included the machines that I have access to, the books in
        								my personal library, and my grandparents and ancestors. Drawing
        								these cards at random, I can begin to think about novel uses of
        								machines and knowledge to design my interventions going forward.</span></p>
