											<p><span>"[D]oings are broader and encompass vastly different
												contexts such as how landscapes are made, and how we operate
												within the academy and what we hope our work achieves (or does).
												This focus on embodied practices is explicitly drawn from
												Indigenous scholarship who have all articulated the vital
												interconnectivity of embodied politics and Indigenous
												resurgence. Regardless of the different origins and ownerships
												of these approaches, they both call for us to attend to what we
												do in the world, the politics of our doings, the emotional,
												embodied practices of doings, the temporalities of acts and,
												crucially, to the inability for us to ever know all about the
												world."</span></p>

											<p><span>"An intensely localised co-becoming links the learner/doer
												into vast networks across place and space, and also time. Given
												these connections across space-time, a call for 'localised'
												engagements with Indigenous place knowledge should not be
												confused with a call for ‘limited’ engagements. Rather,
												engagements with place-agency and placing-time in Indigenous
												knowledge open up new possibilities for geographical theory and
												practice."</span></p>

											<p><span>Barker, Adam J., and Jenny Pickerill. <i>"Doings with the
												Land and Sea: Decolonising Geographies, Indigeneity, and
												Enacting Place-Agency."</i> Progress in Human Geography 44, no. 4
												(August 2020): 640–62. <a class="mdeflinks" href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132519839863" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132519839863</a>.</span></p>

											<p><span>The trajectory of the overall program of acknowledging
												emergent origins is to go beyond the concept of decolonization
												in terms of Indigenous governments and Nations States. In order
												to achieve this broader definition, I am exploring the agency of
												land being merely being territory to occupy towards exercising
												political authority over humans and non-humans. In the context
												of humanism vs. post-humanism, there is a third tier that is
												better aligned in Indigenous cosmovision. Baker and Pickerell
												describe the development of knowledge, emotions, feelings, and
												intuition through "doings." The definition of this asks us to
												consider the influences and effects of our actions within a
												given geography. Furthermore, to give a place agency is to
												acknowledge the relationship formed through localized
												engagements that remain with the doer in a process of
												co-becoming.</span></p>

											<p><span>
												The purpose of the current intervention is to scale first person
												language exploration and documentation by exposing workflows and
												engaging stakeholders through <a class="mdeflinks"
													href="https://www.instagram.com/veusderesistenciabcn/"
													target="_blank">social media</a>. The broader impact is to
												increase the presence of local language and knowledge in online
												platforms. Further, geographical and political data are curated
												to better contextualize and promote awareness of the needs and
												priorities of the local community. Additionally, the platform is
												documented such that it can be applied to any language community
												thinking of resources for revitalization. Because the language
												and knowledge are local, we are acknowledging place-based
												epistemologies that sustain non-human constituents (including
												the land).

											<h4><span>The speaking subject of the designer of things</span></h4>
											<div class="body-text-img">

											<p><span>My goals and vision for the project are: local knowledge
												development; sustainable linguistic diversity; and agency of
												land and ecosystem. In mapping out the human and non-human
												stakeholders, it is clear that there needs to be an accouting
												for existing linguistic, political, and cultural diversity. My
												primary driving force is forming community with the local
												Catalan language revitalization efforts in a way that increases
												understanding of the tools and processes of language
												documentation from a context of building solidarity as an
												Indigenous community language activist.</span></p>

											<p><span>Where friction exists is in the design decisions of whose
												use of the local language is a valid sample of the needs and
												priorities of the local community. While my own politics skew in
												a certain direction, I'm wondering whether there should be
												inclusion of right wing ephemera. Even within the context of the
												social media account <a class="mdeflinks"
													href="https://www.instagram.com/veusderesistenciabcn/"
													target="_blank">@veusderesistenicabcn</a>, whose resistence
												should be included in the overall narrative that I am
												portraying? Are the issues of worker, immigrant, and women's
												rights inherently aligned with a left leaning or socialist
												agenda in the local environment? Furthermore, in terms of
												stewardship of the local ecosystem whose agenda best aligns?</span></p>

											<p><span>Ultimately, the centered experience within the
												intervention is myself and documentation should reflect how the
												local environment shapes my future biography through a
												relationship rooted in a certain time and space.</span></p>
											<h4><span>The future of your biography</span></h4>
											<p><span>
												There are (at least) three platforms engaged when thinking about
												the scaling of Language in Context. First would be the static
												forms of documentation that serve as a snapshot for the
												development phase. These include the MDEF - Fab Academy archives
												and the <a class="mdeflinks"
													href="https://www.instagram.com/veusderesistenciabcn/"
													target="_blank">Instagram account</a>. These can be revisited
												to add to the exploration and form a deeper connection with a
												broader scope of space and time from the formal conclusion of
												the initial project. Exposing the project to open-source
												documentation platforms such as Appropedia, GitLab, and
												SCOPES-df; the processes engaged in can be forked, remixed, and
												extended to applications within other language communities.
												Third is in the global insights of a community-based language
												documentation research community that can be applied at a local
												level to my own Tribe's language revitalization programming.
												This research can be developed and curated on a local level and
												additional modules can be conceived to adapt to the needs and
												priorities of my own community.
