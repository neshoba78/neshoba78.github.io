								<h1><span>Design Studio - Autoethnography</span></h1>

										<h4><span>January 26, 2021</span></h4>

											<p><span>The role of theory?</span></p>

											<p><span>In Making Design Theory, Johan Redström describes theory
												development in design research as "driven by practice,
												experimentation, and making." Basic definitions as theoretical
												parts and structures are made through design in at least three
												different ways:</span></p>

											<ol>
												<li><p><span>How do we use abstraction through combinations of
													fluid terms to describe issues and ideas? How is conceptual
													precision in design theory impacted by this language?</span></p></li>
												<li><p><span>How do we address more complex issues through the
													act of making? Further how are our definitions of individual
													concepts supporting conceptual development?</span></p></li>
												<li><p><span>How can we better understand basic beliefs or
													worldview through "programs" or frameworks whether or not
													educational that help us coordinate projects or a specific
													practice?</span></p></li>
											</ol>

											<p><span>Through this lens, the project of "Language in Context"
												lives within the scope of the overall "Acknowledging Emergence
												Origins" program. This further the exploration of the role of
												the role of the designer outside of his or her homeland who
												Redström further attributes to:</span></p>
											<ol>
												<li><p><span>Acting on the physical world;</span></p></li>
												<li><p><span>Addressing human needs; and</span></p></li>
												<li><p><span>Generating the built environment</span></p></li>
											</ol>

											<p><span>Further there’s a critical perspective to be applied when
												exploring a built environment through public facing ephemera.
												Are the language samples: advertising for businesses, public
												notices, historical plaques, or street art. What can be learned
												as far as the needs, priorities, and demands of the community
												and ecosystem that the designer is entering into? How can the
												designer be an accomplice in addressing the needs, priorities,
												and demands of the community?</span></p>



											<p><span>What kinds of questions do you ask for your
												auto-ethnography?</span></p>

											<p><span>In thinking about communicating emergent futures, I quote
												Philip Deloria. Deloria speaks about authenticity and the
												constructed image of the Other. Otherness is coded in terms of:</span></p>
											<ol>
												<li><p><span>Time, which can be nostalgia or archaism;</span></p></li>
												<li><p><span>Place, which in the context of this program is
													either inside of outside of the designer’s homeland; and</span></p></li>
												<li><p><span>Culture, which is objectified through ethnography</span></p></li>
											</ol>

											<p><span>In "Radical love as a strategy for social transformation",
												Andrew Jolivette proposes a Collective Ceremonial Research
												Responsiveness (CCRR) structure. In this context of a designer
												as a researcher, I must ask:</span></p>
											<ol>
												<li><p><span>Am I using tools and processes that foster a
													collective endeavour and a shared knowledge creation process
													between the community and academia?</span></p></li>
												<li><p><span>Am I distinguishing my own design or research as a
													ceremonial act or mutual respect and co-sharing with community
													experts, traditional knowledge keepers, and cultural leaders?</span></p></li>
												<li><p><span>Am I being selective in design or research proposals
													to be responsive to social indicators (social, legal, economic,
													cultural, and political) as defined by community experts?</span><p></li>
											</ol>

											<p><span>How does my intervention go towards the overall program of
												building trust with community experts?</span></p>

							<div class="body-text-img"><img src="assets/images/emergence origins-1.jpg" /></div>

											<p><span>What kind of stories you tell?</span></p>

											<p><span>In designing for emergent futures under a weak signal of
												imagining a non-Western centric future specifically in the
												context of Indigenous futurism themes, I explore several
												aspects:</span></p>

											<p><span>
												Thinking in terms of:<br /> Native Slipstream - non-linear
												thinking about space-time. navigating pasts, presents, and
												futures in one stream.
											</span></p>

											<p><span>When opening up the project to collaboration with the
												Dérive Collective, I followed a historical and contemporary path
												of Indigenous peoples from the Americas in Barcelona. I started
												with the depictions of Taino and Arawak at the base of El
												Monument a Colón. This was contextualised through the work of
												Daniela Ortiz. Wandering through Barri Gotic, we find Nativa
												which is founded by the family or José Luis Cotacachi (Otavalo)
												from Northern Ecuador. Espacio del Immigrante invites further
												engagement with an exterior mural by Felipe "Pincel" Echeverría.
												Coincidentally the Centre Cultural in El Clot features another
												mural by Pincel. It’s here where I go to pray and reflect daily.</span></p>

											<p><span>
												Thinking in terms of:<br /> Native Apocalypse - transition from
												a state of imbalance to a state of balance by illustrating
												trauma to provide healing.
											</span></p>

											<p><span>The imbalance in this intervention is being separated from
												the comfort zone of my own homeland and adopted environment. The
												journey is about making sense of the foreign built environment
												to find pieces of my own home to construct a narrative and
												continuity to position myself within a community.</span></p>

											<p><span>
												Thinking in terms of:<br /> Biskaabiiyang, "Returning to
												Ourselves" - investigating how one is affected by colonization,
												discarding emotional and psychological baggage, and adapting to
												a post-Native Apocalypse world.
											</span></p>

											<p><span>I have to question myself and my motivations for
												assimilation into the foreign environment. Is my sense of style
												and apparel influenced by my own constructed ideas of an Other?
												What are the power dynamics to navigate when an Indigenous
												person assumes the role of an immigrant? Do I owe it to
												communities that benefit from my colonisation to assimilate and
												conform to an image that they are comfortable with?</span></p>

											<p><span>
												Thinking in terms of:<br /> Contact - reframing resistance and
												oppression in a way that implicates the part of individuals in
												larger realities.
											</span></p>

											<p><span>Ultimately, when addressing colonisation and
												decolonisation to go beyond the context of land as merely
												territory; I have to acknowledge how my own nation benefitted
												from the process of colonisation. We are active in the
												historical record with international relations and participation
												in international trade. While it may be less obvious to
												communities that I seek to co-create with, I have to understand
												how history and my own community’s role shape my assumptions of
												my presence in a foreign land.</span></p>

											<p><span>
												Thinking in terms of:<br /> Indigenous Science and
												Sustainability - traditional sustainable practices constitute a
												science, despite a lack of an analogous taxonomy to western
												science.
											</span></p>

											<p><span>CCRR reference above applied to design theory as developed
												through making means that there are specific protocols for the
												co-creation of shared knowledge in which an academic is at best
												an accomplice while respecting the intellectual property of the
												community as unalienable.</span></p>

							<div class="body-text-img"><img src="assets/images/emergence origins-2.jpg" /></div>

											<p><span>How do you provide evidence?</span></p>

											<p><span>Evidence is provided in:</span></p>
											<ol>
												<li><p><span>Photographic samples of posted language ephemera;</span></p></li>
												<li><p><span>Tracking data from language learning applications;</span></p></li>
												<li><p><span>Language proficiency measured through application
													performance;</span></p></li>
												<li><p><span>Text to Speech samples; and</span></p></li>
												<li><p><span>Mapping of a community of practice through local
													exploration</span></p></li>
											</ol>

											<p><span>Why is it meaningful for you?</span></p>

											<p><span>As discussed in the Biology Zero reflection, panelists
												from the Indigenous Survivance panel at Global Community Bio
												summit 4.0 offer specific guidance for working with (Indigenous)
												communities. Beno Juarez’s guidance specifically resonates in
												which he tells people to buy a ticket and visit the jungle (or
												immerse yourself in the local geography), live the cosmovision
												(or follow the local ways and beliefs), and learn the language.</span></p>

											<p><span>How do you find your own community (on-line), group of
												practice? How do you create a reflexive relationship?</span></p>

											<p><span>After mapping and building language proficiency, I feel
												better equipped to begin contact with communities who share
												identity and practices with me locally. In building a reflexive
												relationship, I need to be transparent about my own identity as
												a designer and the research framework to which I am held
												accountable.</span></p>
