        <p><span>And then came the class in which the rubber met the road,
            or the laser met the cardboard.</span></p>
        <p><span>I started out using the laser cutters at the South End
            Technology Center. Beckett Dunning, an alumnus of Learn to Teach
            Teach to Learn, guided us through the process of sending a job
            to the laser cutter. At the Tech Center, there are two models:
            Epilog Legend 24 and a Mini 24.</span></p>
        <div class="body-text-img">
          <img src="assets/images/IMG_3597.JPG" alt="">
        </div>
        <p><span>Rule #1 of laser cutting is: Don&#x2019;t Burn Down the
            Place (what are you nuts?). Beckett walked us through proper
            safety precautions. He told us not to leave the laser cutter
            while a job was running. He demonstrated how to maintain proper
            air flow with the air pump and internal filtration system. The
            air assist pump reduces flare ups which cause the edges of the
            part to be scorched. As the laser pulses across the job, waste
            material or kerf is burned away to cut the part out of the stock
            (such as wood, acrylic, or aluminum). The internal filtration
            system or external ventilation system then removes the waste
            from the machine to reduce the chance of fires. Regardless of
            equipment, it&#x2019;s still best to remain at the laser with a
            fire extinguisher or fire blanket in case of emergency.</span></p>

        </div>
        <p><span>In addition to Fab Academy, I have been collaborating with
            Luciano Betoldi and other members of the Fab Lab Network to
            compose the Fab Lab Installation Manual. This document details
            the set up of different machines that provide the capabilities
            that define what a fab lab is. My experience with laser cutters
            so far has been not only using them, but installing drivers,
            software, and helping to trouble shoot mechanical problems.</span></p>
        <p><span>At NOLA Fab Lab at Delgado Community College, we had
            issues connecting Mini 24&#x2019;s to computers through USB
            ports. While it&#x2019;s not explicit on the Epilog website, I
            thought that the issue may be because only some of the ports
            were USB 2.0. We had a similar issue with the Sense 3D scanner
            which needed a USB 3.0 connection for power. Because of this
            issue, I opted to connect the machine through the ethernet port.
            When we discussed the connection with the install team, the
            ethernet port was preferred as a more reliable connection than
            USB.</span></p>
        <p><span>Back in Boston at Fab@CIC, we installed two laser cutters:
            an Epilog Fusion M2 32 and a Legend 24 TT. The second one was
            donated by Neil Gershenfeld to The Fab Foundation. It had issues
            with the Y-axis and laser alignment. We contacted Mike Boyd at
            Axis Services to diagnose and service the machine. I was on-hand
            to help and document what the issues were. While disassembling
            the machine, Mike pointed out that the screws holding the sides
            were so tight that they may have torqued the machine. For Mike,
            his mantra was &#x201C;snug, but not tight.&#x201D; We went
            through the machine disassembling and testing the motion along
            the X and Y axis. While we did change out the Y motor, the main
            issue were the front and back bearings which were worn. These
            bearings are less available through Epilog, but should be easily
            locally sourced through a hardware store. Getting a job to the
            machine was the next step. The Legend 24 TT only has 32-bit
            drivers and all of the computers in the lab are 64-bit. I looked
            into several options to install the driver which almost required
            a virtual box on the Windows side. I tried two different cables
            to connect the machine to the computer: Belkin 6-Foot CAT5e
            Crossover Networking Cable and Sabrent USB to Parallel IEEE 1284
            Printer Cable Adapter (CB-CN36). With the USB to Parallel, I was
            able to find the machine under add printers on Ubuntu 14.04. I
            then added it as a Generic, Raw Queue printer named
            &#x201C;laser.&#x201D; The desktop version of Fab Modules was
            able to send jobs without issue.</span></p>

          <img src="assets/images/IMG_3615.JPG" alt="">
        </div>
        <p><span>We covered several types of joints in the lecture for this
            assignment. I decided to make my own version of GIK using
            Inkscape to draw SVG shapes that can be brought into Fab
            Modules. I haven&#x2019;t worked out sending jobs from Inkscape.
            The current workaround is to save out as a PDF and send from
            Adobe Acrobat. The main consideration for sending jobs is to be
            sure that strokes (outlines for shapes of parts to be cut) must
            be .001 to .003 inches or .0254 to .0762 mm.</span></p>
        <p><span>

          </span></p>
        <p><span>Using Inkscape, I was able to create shapes and clones of
            shapes. These are all defined as SVG elements in the XML Editor.
            Shapes have either basic geometry or are defined as paths.
            Clones have use IDs and references to the original shapes. SVG
            elements have attributes that can be adjusted parametrically
            such as dimensions or transforms. In order to perform additive
            or subtractive boolean operations, those have to be done in the
            document. Once those operations are performed, a new path
            element is created. History of the new element is only retained
            by the undo button. So, it&#x2019;s better to use an application
            like Antimony or FreeCAD to have parametric and hierarchical
            modeling.</span></p>

        </div>
        <p><span>The vinyl cutter was an old friend from my sign shop days.
            In Central Louisiana, I would use the vinyl cutter for several
            applications including: decals, corrugated signs, and masks for
            screen printing. In 2015, I made a Pokemon decal for my laptop.
            To do that, I downloaded a stylized design for Mewtwo and
            Lucario and then traced the bitmap using the plugin in Inkscape.
            The trick for more complicated designs like this is the
            attention to nodes within the SVG document. Curved lines can be
            rendered by the Bitmap tracer as several nodes along one curve.
            The idea is to reduce the number of nodes and adjust handles to
            the point where each line (straight or curved) is the travel
            between two points. This gives the cut a more natural travel,
            and the overall decal becomes easier to weed.</span></p>
        <div class="body-text-img">
          <img src="assets/images/IMG_3903.JPG" alt="">
        </div>
        <p><span>The goal of cutting with the vinyl cutter is to only cut
            the adhesive material and not the substrate. The knife only
            sticks out about the depth of a fingernail. You also have to
            balance the amount of force applied to cut the material. I once
            tried cutting Fab Foundation decals at a DigiFabCon in
            Cambridge, MA. Jean-Michel Molenaar came by the booth and saw
            that the force that I had was around 45. He immediately bumped
            the force up to 90 which made nice cuts that weeded very well.</span></p>
