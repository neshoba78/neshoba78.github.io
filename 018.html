											<blockquote>"The authentic, as numerous scholars have pointed out, is
												a culturally constructed category created in opposition to a
												perceived state of inauthenticity. The authentic serves as a way
												to imagine and idealise the real, the traditional, and the
												organic in opposition to the less satisfying qualities of
												everyday life. The ways people construct authenticity depend
												upon the received heritage that has defined the authentic past.
												Because those seeking authenticity have already defined their
												own sate as inauthentic, they easily locate authenticity in the
												figure of an Other. This Other can be coded in terms of time
												(nostalgia or archaism), place (the small town), or culture
												(Indianness). The quest for such an authentic Other is a
												characteristically modern phenomenon, one that has often been
												played out in contradictions surrounding America's long and
												ambivalent engagement with Indianness."</blockquote>

											</div>
											<p><span>In Philip Joseph Deloria's fourth chapter of Playing
												Indian he recounts the story of Canadian author Ernest Thompson
												Seton. One of the cofounders of the Boy Scouts of America, Seton
												clashes with a contemporary, Daniel Carter Beard, in methods to
												respond to the turn of the twentieth century. For both, American
												children are "imperilled by an effeminate, post frontier
												urbanism," according to Deloria. While Beard relies upon the
												recreation of pioneer scouts, Seton constructs experiences of an
												Indian Other. Deloria quotes Seton saying, "Our civilisation is
												a failure. Whenever pushed to its logical conclusion, it makes
												one millionaire and a million paupers. There is no complete
												happiness under this blight." Deloria also presents a critique
												of the then emerging field of ethnography. It's "claim to
												scientific legitimacy lay in an accumulation of details that
												proved the transgression of temporal and cultural boundaries and
												a subsequent return with objective knowledge." Deloria cites the
												role of ethnographers and anthropologists in consulting with
												Seton to bolster his own credibility through a scientific
												foundation of the Indian Other.</span></p>

											<p><span>In earlier chapters, Deloria provides a genealogy of
												"Indian play," from the Boston Tea Party to fraternal orders
												such as the Improved Order of Red Men. Deloria describes a
												confluence of three interconnected bodies of thought in the
												early twentieth century. The ethnographer objectively captures
												Indians in premodern character through data collection and
												photography. Psychologists argue for a primitive stage of
												development for children with an affinity with the Indian Other.
												The ability to gain access to authentic Indian Other identities
												through mimesis and imitation is further reinforced through
												ethnography and primitivism.</span></p>

											</div>
											<p><span>American Indians are not passive in the extraction and
												appropriation of identity and culture through the construction
												of an Indian Other reinforced by ethnography. Deloria cites the
												historian Frederick Hoxie by characterising American Indian
												contemporaries of Seton as "pragmatic--claiming connection to
												the appealing anti modernity of the old ways, yet also bold,
												literate, and astute in seeing the benefits of explaining
												traditional pasts in terms of modern concerns."</span></p>
											<p><span>
												Thinking in terms of:<br /> Native Slipstream - non-linear
												thinking about space-time. navigating pasts, presents, and
												futures in one stream.
											</span></p>

											<p><span>In asserting American Indian identity, I often think of
												the need to "walk between worlds." There is society within the
												constraints of political maps. Colorful representations within
												clean black perimeters marked with place names in languages that
												may be foreign to the lands depicted. In that world, I follow a
												Gregorian calendar and a 24 hour day, in consensus with a global
												majority. Then, there is a world that overlaps with the
												constraints of political maps. Amorphous boundaries of
												traditional Indigenous territories that are known in heritage
												languages. The world is modern with varying degrees of cultural
												continuity, depending upon points of disruption. We debate about
												the status of cosmovision and whether to construct neologisms in
												literal or metaphorical languages. In this way, we can have
												translated analogs of knowledge that either integrate with older
												ways of knowing or render them obsolete.</span></p>

											<p><span>
												Thinking in terms of:<br /> Native Apocalypse - transition from
												a state of imbalance to a state of balance by illustrating
												trauma to provide healing.
											</span></p>

											<p><span>Louis Martinié, primary drummer for the New Orleans Voodoo
												Spiritual Temple, along with Sallie Ann Glassman offer a
												divergent image from the traditional Tower card in the New
												Orleans VooDoo Tarot. Titled "Deluge" the card depicts a levee
												breaking and river water pouring into a neighbourhood and
												washing away vehicles from roads. Apocalypse being an event that
												brings about great destruction and violent change is shown in
												this card through a devastated landscape. What is important to
												note however is the description given in the accompanying book
												with the deck. Martinié states that one should be like air and
												let the waters pass through, else risking being swept up in the
												floodwaters. This image and description come to mind as I
												reflect on the position of American Indians in the early
												twentieth century.</span></p>

											<p><span>
												Thinking in terms of:<br /> Biskaabiiyang, "Returning to
												Ourselves" - investigating how one is affected by colonization,
												discarding emotional and psychological baggage, and adapting to
												a post-Native Apocalypse world.</span></p>

											<p><span>There is a complicated relationship with ethnography
												coming from the early twentieth century, especially in the
												context of current language and culture revitalisation efforts
												in my own community. On the one hand, we are fortunate to have
												the extent of data coming from ethnographers and anthropologists
												in order to reconstruct an identity in stasis. This is even more
												important given the events such as the fire that claimed the
												National Museum of Brazil. What we have to be cautious about is
												the alienation of ancestral knowledge through an idealised
												construction of identity. Written data, photographs, and audio
												recordings are not a substitute for transmission of knowledge
												from elder to youth.</span></p>

											<p><span>
												Thinking in terms of:<br /> Contact - reframing resistance and
												oppression in a way that implicates the part of individuals in
												larger realities.
											</span></p>

											<p><span>Settler colonists are once-armed with swords, bayonets,
												and diseases. The ethnographers and anthropologists of Seton's
												time are armed with pencils, paper, and recording devices. There
												is an odd willingness to conspire and befriend these agents of
												Western institutionalised knowledge. In fact, our family
												continues to navigate complex relationships with academia to
												revitalise language and culture. While at times not to our
												advantage, we work beyond the awkward smiles and chuckles of
												academics well versed in taxonomy who are amused by our best
												translations of ancestral knowledge.</span></p>

											<p><span>
												Thinking in terms of:<br /> Indigenous Science and
												Sustainability - traditional sustainable practices constitute a
												science, despite a lack of an analogous taxonomy to western
												science.
											</span></p>

											<p><span>It is ultimately affirming that traditional ecological
												knowledge is applied as a response to the failures of modern
												society. What we are cautious to avoid is the relegating of a
												cosmovision in stasis to a point in the distant past. Our worlds
												are overlapping with differing scales of development. What is
												more important is that youth understand that the knowledge of
												their ancestors remains and stewards a supermajority of the
												planet's biodiversity.</span></p>
