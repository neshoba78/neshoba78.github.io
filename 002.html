										<p><span>My "hike" on Thursday came in the form of participation in
											the Boston Climate Strike which was organized by a coalition
											including North American Indian Center of Boston (NAICOB).
											Central to the purpose of marching with Climate Strike to make
											links between the perspectives of the intersectional
											participants who voiced the interconnectedness of white
											supremacy, extractive economies, capitalism, rights of immigrant
											workers (who are often Indigenous peoples displaced by disputes
											over land, threats of sexual assault, and other stressors).</span></p>

										<p><span>For my personal role, I did speak on the initiative by
											NAICOB and United American Indians of New England (UAINE) to
											establish Indigenous Peoples Day and to remove a statue of
											Christopher Columbus from public display. There were a couple of
											inconsistencies on my own part as I took a work-related call
											from The Fab Foundation up until the time of my presentation.
											While juggling work and activism is part of how I navigate
											multiple systems, it was inconsistent with the message of the
											action to not work or not contribute to the economy. My staff
											member from NAICOB bought a Starbucks coffee for me which gave
											me a feeling of guilt, but I justified the action by drawing a
											black cross against the corporate logo.</span></p>

										<p><span>We continued the march through downtown Boston, and I
											threw my coffee cup away in a recycling bin without taking a
											photo. What I did take photos of were a small dog that moved
											through the crowd which helped cheer participants yet distracted
											from speakers. The speakers were in the bed of a pick up truck
											which is useful for compelling presentations yet contributes to
											the fossil fuel economy. A restaurant with mannequins seated in
											every other booth also piqued my interest. I started to question
											the inconsistencies even as we commit to direct actions to
											challenge systemic inequalities. Any the same time, it was
											interesting to see a bit of dystopia in how status quo is
											upheld.</span></p>
