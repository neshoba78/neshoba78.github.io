								<h1><span>Reframing Your Project</span></h1>

										<h4><span>January 12, 2021</span></h4>

											<h4><span>Towards a
												Land Acknowledgement of Barcelona</span></h4>

											</div>

											<p><span>After the
												Term 1 Design Dialogue, my takeaway centered around my personal
												practice of land acknowledgements. This is a feature of public
												speaking in which a person recognizes their positionality as a
												guest on land away from their homeland. For the purpose of my
												own research, I define homeland as a place where one’s ancestors
												are buried. In the practice, the specific person recognizes him
												or her self as a guest and acknowledges the hosts. These are
												people whose ancestors are buried in this specific place.
												Furthermore, in my specific practice of land acknowledgements,
												this is followed by a pledge to align oneself with the
												priorities of the hosts. My goal is to follow this process
												towards reframing my project as I am in different geographic
												context.</span></p>

											<p><span>One day into
												the intervention, I advanced several levels in Español and
												Català in DuoLingo. I am following the recommended 20 minute
												daily time for "intense" study. The gameification of language
												acquisition through DuoLingo is addictive, but perhaps less
												harmful than submitting myself to constant social media. In
												order to access the Català lessons, I had to search for course
												for Español speakers. Because I assessed my Español proficiency
												at the beginning of the DuoLingo courses, I felt comfortable
												taking the lessons in a secondary language. The documenting of
												yesterday's exposure in El Clot went a little slower than
												expected as I spent time refining the style and presentation of
												the photos. Because the focus is on Català for local exposure, I
												am only transcribing photos with the language present. These are
												individual text files which I merge periodiocally. The merged
												text is imported into Google sheets and translated one word at a
												time using the Google Translate function. Duplicates from the
												word list are removed. Finally, I export a csv for words sampled
												from the day's exploration. The first day's exposure was 523
												unique words. The digitization of my efforts seems to be a
												priority as I found a few intervention centering the
												preservation of Català in the digital age. Catotron is a text to
												speech synthesizer trained through neural networks. I am able to
												test the Ona model against the language samples taken daily. I
												would also like to dig deeper into Project AINA. A presentation
												for that project is embedded below. El Clot appears to be a
												neighborhood with an older population. I thought the Escola
												Octavio Paz which was discovered during the walk would be a good
												resource for partnerships going forward.</span></p>
												<p><span>Scaling the project, I started a <a class="mdeflinks" href="https://www.instagram.com/veusderesistenciabcn/" target="_blank">social media account</a> which exposes language content captured while marked with location data in Català.</span></p>
