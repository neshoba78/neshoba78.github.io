								<h1><span>Atlas of Weak Signals Module I Design for the Anthropocene</span></h1>
										<h4><span>October 26, 2020</span></h4>

											<p><span>In thinking about the Atlas of Weak Signals, I decided to explore in terms of Indigenous
												Futurism themes as curated in the collection walking the clouds which is edited by Grace
												Dillon. Starting in November 2019, I facilitated a reading group titled “indigenous
												futurism 2420: 400 years / 5 moons.” The reading group met on each new and full moon and
												read through the collection while reflecting on each of the stories. We did this within
												the Boston Makers makerspace.</span></p>
											<div class="body-text-img">
												<img src="assets/images/index.jpg" alt="indigenous futurism banner" />
											</div>
											<p><span>The group was designed to help urban Indian (Indigenous peoples living away from their
												traditional homelands in urban spaces) community members to reflect and design
												interventions that would respond to the themes in the book. Furthermore, the timing of
												the series was in response to the 400th anniversary of the landing of the Mayflower
												which is a ship that brought settlers commonly known as pilgrims into Wampanoag
												territory. This series was ultimately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Still the
												present day realities resonated with the past and the futures that we were visioning.</span>

											<p><span><b>Future Ancestral Technologies: nágshibi, an exhibition promoting global consciousness
													through indigenous science fiction</b></span></p>

											</div>
											<p><span>The intervention that most resonated with the weak signals discussed in this session was
												Future Ancestral Technologies by Cannupa Hanska Luger.</span></p>

											<p><span>By using Indigenous storytelling tradition through a multimedia exhibit, Luger wove a
												tale that explained the origins of humanity and its interdependence on other species. He
												then walks us through colonization and industrialization beyond collapse of society.
												Most of the imagery is from a time over 80 years after a mass exodus of wealthy humans
												which leaves a world of revitalized indigeneity, inter-species collaboration inclusive
												of artificially intelligent beings, and spiritual reawakening.</span></p>

											<p><span><b>About the exhibition</b></span></p>
											<p><span>Future Ancestral Technologies debuted in 2018 in the form of an immersive exhibition at
												the University of South Dakota. A series of land-acknowledgment performative actions
												have since followed and manifest as video works, several of which will be on view in the
												Media Art Gallery. The project continues through the prototyping of dwellings, clothing,
												tools, and videos that illustrate a world in which artificial intelligence and virtual
												reality support ritual and ceremony. Though currently viewed via exhibitions and in
												other art world contexts, this project operates under the assumption that these artworks
												will become useful in the future.</span></p>

											<p><span><b>About the artist</b></span></p>
											<p><span>Cannupa Hanska Luger is a New Mexico-based, multi-disciplinary artist. Raised on the
												Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota, he is of Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara, Lakota,
												Austrian, and Norwegian descent. Using social collaboration and in response to timely
												and site-specific issues, Luger produces multi-pronged projects that take many forms.

											<p><span>Thinking about Climate Conscience in terms of:<br />
												Biskaabiiyang, "Returning to Ourselves" - investigating how one is affected by
												colonization, discarding emotional and psychological baggage, and adapting to a
												post-Native Apocalypse world.</span></p>

											<p><span>This form of intervention builds upon local traditional knowledge and spiritual practices
												by imagining a future in which humans adapt to global collapse by adopting dances,
												regalia, and songs as imagined by Luger. It asks the question of: how do we reclaim
												traditional knowledge and bring it forward to respond to present or future realities?
											</span></p>

											<p><span>Thinking about Inter-species solidarity in terms of:</span></p>
											<p><span>Contact - reframing resistance and oppression in a way that implicates the part of
												individuals in larger realities.</span></p>

											<p><span>This form of intervention builds upon the idea of inter-species solidarity through
												storytelling which recounts an original treaty with the Buffalo that continues in a
												pay-it-forward fashion to include treaties between humans and artificially intelligent
												beings that were salvaged after global collapse. It asks the question(s) of: when we
												define interspecies collaboration, how inclusive are we thinking? What is the impact of
												artificial intelligence and human crafted consciousness?</span></p>

											<p><span>Thinking about Long termism in terms of:<br />
												Native Slipstream - non-linear thinking about space-time. navigating pasts, presents,
												and futures in one stream.</span></p>

											<p><span>The form of intervention merges past, present, and future together to build a narrative
												that treats time as cyclical in form. It asks the question of: how can we reflect on our
												relationship with creation (other humans, other species, nature, etc.) to conceive of
												agreements or plans of action towards futures well beyond our lifetimes?</span></p>

											<p><span>Thinking about Carbon neutral lifestyles in terms of:<br />
												Indigenous Science and Sustainability - traditional sustainable practices constitute a
												science, despite a lack of an analogous taxonomy to western science.</span></p>

											<p><span>This form of intervention promotes Indigenous science and sustainability by applying
												traditional methods of making that is agnostic to materials. It asks the question of: in
												a changing world that impacts the range of materials for traditional crafting, how do we
												continue processes that promote spirituality and sustainability?</span></p>

											<p><span>Thinking about Fighting Anthropocene in terms of:<br />
												Native Apocalypse - transition from a state of imbalance to a state of balance by
												illustrating trauma to provide healing.</span></p>

											<p><span>This form of intervention uses the genre of science fiction to promote global
												consciousness by depicting healing after a great trauma. It asks the question: how can
												we return to a state of balance through renewed relationships with other species and
												restorative justice between humans and creation?</span></p>

											<p><span>In reflecting on the planetary crisis and the weak signals through the themes of
												Indigenous futurism and Luger’s intervention, I am challenged by how I identify as an
												Indigenous person. I ask myself: what does that mean in the modern context? Am I reliant
												on the social structures and agreements that my people have with Nation States? What
												would it mean to be Indigenous to Earth after a climate crisis and global collapse
												leading to interplanetary migration?</span></p>
